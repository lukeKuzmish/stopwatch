# STOPWATCH
This is a simple stopwatch app that is written in HTML and JavaScript.  It was inspired by [online-stopwatch.com](http://www.online-stopwatch.com) which I noticed was written in Flash.  Well, that simply would not do, so I decided to write this as an exercise.

## Known Issues:
- pressing start multiple times makes things blow up
- ugly
- cross-browser issues (onclick?)
